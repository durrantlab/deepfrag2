Overview
========

<name> is a minimal framework for data transformation in a structural biology machine learning pipeline. It is intended to minimize the boilerplate required to interoperate between biological datasets, cheminformatics libraries and machine learning frameworks.

Currently it supports RDKit as the cheminformatics backend and PyTorch as the machine learning backend.
